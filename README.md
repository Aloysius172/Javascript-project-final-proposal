Javascript Project Final Proposal: Stack Paper

Background

This game will be a 2d rendering with a background, items and a character that match a theme. The character will be on the bottom of the view and will have the ability to move back and forth. The character will have a receptor and with the receptor the character will be moving under items as they fall from the top of the view toward the bottom of the view. There will be different types of items faalling from the top of the view, some will be desirable and some will be undesirable. The items will be able to stack onto the top of one another if they are one of the desirable items. If an undesirable item falls onto the top of the stack, it will be counted toward a maximum amount of undesirable items allowed to continue the game. If that maximum number of undesirable items is reached, the game will end and the height of the stack at the end of the game will be added displayed upon the games ending.
